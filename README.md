## Overview of Statistical Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to see temperature trends before we open the surf shop. I need to provide the temperature data for the months of June and Decemebr for all of the years that are in the sql file. 

## Results

*There are almost 200 more entries for data for the month of June.
*The min temperature in June is 8 degrees higher than the min temperature for December.
*The June max temperature is only 2 degrees higher than the max temperature for December. 

Below are the data stats for June and December:

## Summary

There are around 200 more entries for June data than Decmeber data. June has higher temperatures than December in all respective temperature statistics. A helpful query would be to find the number of days in June that the temperatrue was below 70 degrees. Another query that would be good to run is to find the number of days that the temperature would be over 80 degrees for December.
